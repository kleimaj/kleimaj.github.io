                <h2>Junior Developer</h2>
                <p id="bio">I'm Jacob, and I'm a junior developer with a bachelor's degree in computer science and ux design.
                    I graduated from Western Washington University in the Spring of 2019,
                    and I'm currently working at <a class="bio_a" href="https://www.universalmusic.com/">Universal Music Group</a> in the Greater Los Angeles Area. </p>
                    <strong>Software</strong>
                    <p>During my college years, I grew more and more passionate about technology.
                I love math and solving complex algorithms, as well as learning new technology. My unique talent is seeing the bigger picture in software, 
                and bringing that picture to life in the most efficient,
                human-centered way possible.</p>
                <strong>UX Design</strong><p>Until this past year, I was able to participate in a UX project, and discovered my passion for researching, ideating, and prototyping. 
                User experience design is so fundamental for software development, if a product does not provide a meaningful experience to the user, it's not worth the time to create.
                </p>
                <strong>Music</strong><p>Music is my will to live. It allows me to be the most in touch with myself, and perfectly aligns me outside of work.
                Based on my works, it's evident that I will tend to embed music in everything that I do, because it's my primary identity. I would be lost without my love for music.</p>
