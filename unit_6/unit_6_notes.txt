Vertical Navigation (page layout)
CSS reset (remove default styling)

Pseudo-class (for hovering)
selector: pseudo-class{
	property: value
}
ex.
a:hover{
	background-color: newColor;
}

display: block: (changes from inline to block elements, now allowed to asign a width and height to each anchor)

Section 2: Floating and Clearing
Float: move elements horizontally (left, right, none)
1. create column layout
2. wrap text around an image
3. horizontal navigation bar
Issues with floats (don't add to height of parent object. Floated elements within object may collapse. Objects further down the page don't know where to go (footer))

clear:both - tells browser youve floated elements and that the next element should begin on it's own new line
tip: assign clear:both to footer

clearfix: after - div adjust to size of children elements

Column Layout
page contains multiple block sections at same vertical height


REVIEW
Nav-Bar (section on web page that links to other pages of the site)

pseduo-class: keyword added to selectors that indicate a condition of the element, for example :hover will apply a style when the user hovers over the element specified by the selector.

clearfix: technique in css automatically clears after an element.. it's used in column layouts where elements are floated. give the floated elements the class clearfix, and create css rule for class with psuedo class :after

Floats and Clears
floats prevent blocking of elements, float: left, right, or none (default is none)
clears turn off the floating. Set clear: both;, if this doesn't work, use clearfix

column layout
wrap blocks of content in div, apply a float, and modify with padding, margin, and border dimensions to adjust their size
