Mobile First
Design first for a small screen, then expand to large browsers
mobile allows users to search the web anytime, anywhere
mobile first mindset: who are my users, what are their behaivors, when do they access content, where are they (physically and online), why do they care, how do they access content?
Takeaways: understand your audience, design is about communication

section 2
apps, mobile websites, responsive websites
native apps (don't need connection to web)
mobile websites (pages specifically coded for mobile devices) downside is maintaining both
mobile sites lack cohesive ux of responsive websites
Responsive Design - optimal experience across a variety of browsers and devices
1. Screen Sizes, resolutions, guidelines
2. Different physical interactions of mobile device vs desktop (fingers instead of mouse, use correct sizing and contrast)  
3.employ gesture based control

section 3 mobile design
mobile user mindsets (different from desktop users)
1. microtasking (users engaged in short intermittent periods)
2. local (users engaging location relevant content) ex. Travel locations on a vacation
3. Boredom (users engaging for a diversion)
Desktop and Mobile (core content should be consistent, organization of content reflects user priorities)
UX Design - process of enhancing customer satisfaction by improving usability ease of use and pleasure
UX Overview (common goals: simplify ways users navigate site)
prototyping stage (conduct research)
site (info)architecture
user flow (sitemap)
wireframe (content areas, focal point and heirarchy)
Visual design, development, testing

Section 4 mobile production
prioritize content. (not all content must exist on both mobile and desktop domains)
replace text with icons
top nav bar links to footer (where more navs are)
expanding and collapsing bars
Toggle menu (advanced css, smooth ux)

image optimization
try to save images as svg
never shrink an image smaller than the largest size it will appear on site
Preview: Tools/Adjust Size

Mobile UX
avoid text smaller than 16px
anchors need padding, large enough for fingertips
mobile doesn't use any toggle visibility
less stable internet connection
limited screen space
users are in motion or in a hurry
